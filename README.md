# ResponsiveDesignIn2016
I did this while I worked for my employer back in 2016. 
I did not know there was something called Github back in that time while I was in a "lots-of-fun" city in midwest, so sorry I could not save my code for today but just some screen shot to give you an idea what I did and how it looked. The Full size version was not very outstanding, however, the mobile version was the key here because my boss was on her way to an important Agricultural Expo with some top level people from both enterprises and goverments in Chicago. And she needed something to show them on their smartphones. I was told to build these five days ahead. After tweaking the design with the other project manager, I finally devlivered it on time. It was not the most appealing look website but my boss was impressed!

# Some Details:
Initially, when I tried to make the site responsive in CSS, it did not work. Then I found out the HTML structure was totally built with "<table> <td> <tr>" back in old time. So what I did was convert these content and structure to "<div>" and "<ul>" and other more responsive container. And then apply CSS to them. There was some JS related works but not too much.
